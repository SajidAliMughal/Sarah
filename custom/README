HOW TO BUILD THE MAC APP
------------------------

1) First run "sbt compile" or "sbt run" in the directory above this.
   That creates the ".class" files we need from the Scala classes.

2) Come into this directory and run "ant". If it all works properly,
   the Mac app will be in the "release" subdirectory of this directory.


HOW TO INSTALL SARAH
--------------------

* At this time the install files are in the Install subdirectory of this directory.
  This is still a work in progress, but I'm aiming to put Sarah's data files in this dir:
  $HOME/Library/Application Support/devdaily.com/Sarah


NOTES
-----

NOTE: Make sure the jarbundler jar file is in the ant/lib folder. I've copied it to ant-1.6.5 and ant-1.7.0.
