Sarah Project README File



                            *** WARNING ***

  As of this wekend, January 22, 2012, SARAH is in a pretty dramatic state of
  flux, and you probably don't want to download the project right now. I hope
  to be finished with all these drastic changes in a day or two. I'm putting
  a user interface on SARAH, and as a result, many files are being moved
  to new locations, with many configuration and build changes as well.




INTRODUCTION

This is the README file for the devdaily.com project named Sarah,
which is named after the house/computer SARAH in the tv show Eureka.

This project is an attempt to build a software tool that:

   * You can communicate with using speech recognition.
   * Can communicate with you using computer voices (text to voice).
   * Executes commands you want run in real time.
   * Runs other processes/threads/agents that can report to you on a schedule,
     or when certain events occur.

Note: I'm mainly pushing this project out here today (November 20, 2011)
      because I need to work on some other things for a little while.
      The project isn't really ready to be shared with the public yet, but
      I'm hoping that by putting it out here, other people might find it
      (and like it), and it will also put pressure on me to keep working on
      it and improving it.


DEMO

You can see a demo of Sarah on YouTube here:

You can also see a demo of my semi-related software robot code on 
YouTube here:

As you can imagine, these two projects might connect at some point in
the future.


SOURCE CODE

I originally wrote this application in Java, and recently I've started
porting it over to Scala. As a result, you'll find a mix of code in the
project. As usual, it needs to be cleaned up, but I'm also trying to 
decide how I want to arrange it. I'd like to create a plugin architecture
similar to what is used in tools like Eclipse, Drupal, or Nagios (bare
minimum architecture, and everything is a plugin).


RUNNING SARAH

If you know how to use Scala and sbt, you can run Sarah from the root
project directory like this:

  sbt run

If you don't know how to use those tools, sorry, I don't have any 
documentation here to help you at this time.


THANKS

This project is built on the excellent speach recognition work of the
CMU Sphinx4 project:

  http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4

I have nothing to do with their work, other than being a fan of their
project, and being very interested in human/computer interaction via
voice/speech, and robotics.
