---++ Short Term

* add properties file for things like username, zip code
* get plugins and plugin api going
* let the user control the voice that's used
* create new "current time" request in Scala
* create new "current date" request in Scala
* let me change current voice (probably need to issue a Mac 'defaults' or 
    possibly an AppleScript command to do this

---++ Long Term

* run all speech text through scala so the ui can know what's being said
  (need this for animations, shorter pauses)
* can i reload commands and sarah.gram on each request?
