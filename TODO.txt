---++ Short Term

* get Sarah to shut down properly (may not be shutting down b/c i keep running it through sbt)
* create new "current time" request in Scala
* create new "current date" request in Scala
* let me change current voice (probably need to issue a Mac 'defaults' or 
    possibly an AppleScript command to do this
* refactor CurrentTimeActor to be a plugin
* create a properties file
  - owner's name (such as for "Hello, Al")

---++ Long Term

* can i reload commands and sarah.gram on each request?
