Notes for SARAH programmers, and SARAH plugin programmers.

---++ SARAH Concepts

Sarah

The class Sarah starts things kicks things off, reads any necessary configuration 
files (future), loads and starts the plugins,  

Ears

The role of the ears is to listen to the user, and pass whatever they 
think the user said to the Brain.


-- Brain --

My main reason for writing this document today is to make these notes about
the Brain class:

* The Brain should be able to respond to multiple requests as
  fast as possible. As a result, it has been implemented as an Actor.

* The Brain needs a way to tell the mouth to stop speaking, that is, to
  interrupt it as needed. This can be because a critical message has come
  in, or because the user wants Sarah to quit speaking. The user may
  say this, or press a button in the UI (future) to get Sarah to stop
  speaking.
   

-- Mouth --

I used to have a class named Mouth, and may return to that design.
An important concept is that the mouth can only say one thing at a time.
